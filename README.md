# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Due to JavaScript Error

This repository demonstrates a scenario where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly to a React component because of a JavaScript error within the component's logic.  The error might be subtle and not immediately apparent, leading to unexpected styling issues.

## Description

The bug occurs in `bug.js`. The Javascript code is completely functional and correct, but if there's an error in the `App` component (for example, incorrect use of hooks or other JavaScript errors), Tailwind CSS classes might not be applied. This issue can be tricky to debug because it combines frontend styling with the potential for runtime JavaScript errors. 

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that addresses the core of the bug, which is handling state and updating it correctly.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server. 
4. Observe that the styling might be incorrect, potentially lacking the classes applied by Tailwind CSS. The button click functionality is fine. If you introduce a Javascript error, the styling will likely also break.

## Solution

The solution involves reviewing and correcting JavaScript errors. Often, this means inspecting the console and checking the component's logic. Once the JavaScript error is corrected, the styling should also be correctly applied by TailwindCSS.
